I am a Quantum Information, computing and particle physics enthusiast and have undergone training and projects in India’s premier institutes (`UM DAE CEBS, TIFR, IISc, HRI and IMSc`) and also with IBM and NPTEL. I am now currently in my fifth year Integrated Masters student in Physics at [University of Mumbai-Department of Atomic Energy Centre for Excellence in Basic Sciences](https://https://www.cbs.ac.in/)

I am also an avid trekker and like to read books, and help managing clubs and societies. More on that [here](https://arbathrinarayanan.github.io/cv/)
